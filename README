notes:
=========================================================================
The audio files (664 files, size ~1gb) can be downloaded from http://www.beatport.com/
using the bash script:

./audio_dl.sh

To download the files manually use links of the following form:
http://geo-samples.beatport.com/lofi/<name of mp3 file>
e.g.:
http://geo-samples.beatport.com/lofi/5377710.LOFI.mp3

To convert the audio files to .wav use (bash + sox):

./convert_audio.sh

To retrieve the genre information, the JSON contained within the website was parsed.
The tempo annotation was extracted from forum entries of people correcting the bpm values (i.e. manual annotation of tempo).
For more information please contact creators.

[2] found some files without tempo. There are:

3041381.LOFI.mp3
3041383.LOFI.mp3
1327052.LOFI.mp3

Their v2 tempo is denoted as 0.0 in tempo and mirex and has no annotation in the JAMS format.

(1): Most of the audio files are 120 seconds long. Exceptions are:
name              length
906760.LOFI.mp3   62
1327052.LOFI.mp3  70
4416506.LOFI.mp3  80
1855660.LOFI.mp3  119
3419452.LOFI.mp3  119
3577631.LOFI.mp3  119
